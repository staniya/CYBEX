- The Telegram token is obtained by talking to the *BotFather* through Telegram and creating a bot, while the owner ID can be obtained by using the `/me` command.
- The database path is the full path to the file that will contain blacklist and contacts. Note that this path should be readable/writable by the user that executes the application.
